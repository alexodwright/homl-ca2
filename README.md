# Hands-On Machine Learning Assignment 2

This machine learning model aims to classify between images of cars and boats. Transfer learning using the `resnet50` model
trained on the `ImageNet` dataset is used to increase its accuracy. The model is trained in `ca2_training.ipynb` and the 
learnings of the model are explored in `ca2_demo.ipynb`. Here images are chosen to test the presence of shorcuts in the model,
 and to also explore what the model has learned. This is accomplished with the use of heatmaps to explore saliency and occlusion sensitivity.
